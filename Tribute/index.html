            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Shane Warne, born on September 13, 1969, is a former Australian cricketer widely regarded as one of the
                greatest spin bowlers in the history of the sport. He was born in Ferntree Gully, Victoria, Australia.

                Warne's cricket journey began in his early years, and he quickly showcased his exceptional talent as a
                leg-spinner. He made his debut for the Victoria state team in the 1990-91 season and soon caught the
                attention of the national selectors. In 1992, at the age of 22, Warne made his international debut for
                Australia in a Test match against India.

                From the outset, Warne displayed remarkable skill, control, and a wide array of deceptive deliveries,
                including his infamous leg-break and the famous "flipper." His ability to extract prodigious turn and
                generate remarkable drift made him a formidable opponent for batsmen around the world.

                Shane Warne's international career spanned from 1992 to 2007, during which he played 145 Test matches,
                taking an astonishing 708 wickets at an average of 25.41. He held the record for the most Test wickets
                until it was surpassed by Muttiah Muralitharan. Warne's impact was not limited to Test cricket; he also
                played 194 One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Australia, claiming 293 wickets.

                Not only was Warne renowned for his exceptional bowling skills, but he was also an entertaining and
                charismatic character on and off the field. His flamboyant personality, along with his remarkable
                performances, made him a popular figure in the cricketing world. He often found himself in the headlines
                for his off-field controversies and personal life.

                Despite facing challenges and controversies, Warne remained a match-winner throughout his career, and
                his exploits played a significant role in Australia's dominance in international cricket during the
                1990s and early 2000s. He was an integral part of the Australian team that won the Ashes series multiple
                times and claimed the ICC Cricket World Cup in 1999.

                After retiring from international cricket in 2007, Warne continued to be involved in the sport through
                various avenues. He played in domestic T20 leagues around the world, including the Indian Premier League
                (IPL), where he captained the Rajasthan Royals to victory in the inaugural season in 2008. He has also
                been a cricket commentator, mentor, and coach.

                Shane Warne's impact on the game of cricket extends beyond his statistics. He revolutionized the art of
                leg-spin bowling and inspired a new generation of spinners. His sheer skill, showmanship, and ability to
                mesmerize batsmen with his spin wizardry have secured his legacy as one of cricket's all-time greats.
